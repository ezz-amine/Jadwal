# Jadwal (Work in Progress) – Multi-List Task Tables

A Go experiment in structured task management,
Jadwal organizes todos across multiple tables or lists—like a lightweight database for your goals.
Designed primarily as a learning project (not a polished tool), it’s a playground for exploring Go, architecture, and open-source collaboration.

## Key Notes:

- 🛠 Work in Progress: Buggy, evolving, and not production-ready.
- 📚 Made for Learning: My goal? To tinker with Go, concurrency, and clean code.
- 🗂 Multi-Table Tasks: Group todos by project, priority, or whimsy (e.g., work, learn-go, groceries).
- 🤝 Open Door Policy: Feel free to use, fork, or critique—merge requests and issues welcome!
